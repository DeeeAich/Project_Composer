#**Project_Composer**
Project Composer is a solo project, where I plan to create a game that allows the player to be in almost full control of an orchestra. The player shall have the ability to dictate the specific speed, pitch and rhythm of their orchestra. The indented plan is to allow the player to create interesting versions of public domain pieces, with room for a variety of interpretations of pieces. This game will likely lack art created by myself, if use art that is not owned or created by myself, I shall reference and credit bellow, along with any uses of music.
