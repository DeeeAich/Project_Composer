# Project_Miners

Project Miners is a solo VR project using assets created by a few friends of mine with their permission. The Game sets the player in the cockpit of a mining rig, the player can control the rig through a mix of moving their arms to control the forward arms on the machine, and further are able to control the treads on the machine by using the joysticks on the controllers. The player is feely able to move around the level, and collect any number of objects as they do so. 

The gameplay loop involves the player moving around the level and finding crystal deposits, the deposites can be drilled and crack open given a certain number of gems depending on their colour. The player then needs to lead the gems back to the drop off box, so that they can collect them for their home base.

### How to play
Movement is controlled through the joysticks, each joystick has control over the corresponding tread. The tank controls are created by design and allow for a large amount of movement oppertunities.

Each of the controllers gives control over one of the arms and it's corresponding tool, the drill is used for breaking gem filled diodes. The hand is used to pick up with the grip button and launch gems with the trigger.
